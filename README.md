# CarbonEmission_ML

## Overview
CarbonEmission_ML is a machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting carbon emissions. The project utilizes historical data to forecast future CO₂ emission levels and provides visualizations for better insights. It is designed to assist companies and organizations in understanding their carbon footprint and taking steps to reduce emissions.

## Features
- CO₂ emission data analysis
- Machine learning-based prediction model
- Data visualization in React
- Suggestions for emission reduction based on predictions

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Backend**: Flask/FastAPI (if applicable)
- **Frontend**: React.js (for data visualization)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Recharts (for React)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for frontend visualization)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HackSmith010/CarbonEmission_ML.git
cd CarbonEmission_ML
```

### Setup the Backend (ML Model)
```bash
python -m venv env  # Create virtual environment (optional)
source env/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
env\Scripts\activate  # Activate virtual environment (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
python main.py  # Run the backend server
```

### Setup the Frontend (React Visualization)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Install dependencies
npm start  # Start React application
```

## Usage
1. Run the backend to process the ML model and serve predictions.
2. Start the frontend to visualize carbon emissions data.
3. Input company-specific CO₂ data to receive predictions and suggestions.
4. Analyze the results to plan emission reduction strategies.
